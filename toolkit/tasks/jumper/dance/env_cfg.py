"""Environment config for jumper.dance: the crab dance, `media/demo.npz`.

The environment itself -- the tracking skeleton made into a hexapod, the
observation names the export accepts, the reward and termination terms -- is
`tasks/jumper/common/dance/env.py`, shared by every dance task. This file holds
what belongs to this one: **every number**, each beside the reasoning that
produced it.

Every threshold in mjlab's tracking task was chosen for a 1.3 m humanoid. This
robot stands 0.105 m tall, so a 0.25 m root-height tolerance is roughly "has it
left the room" rather than "has it fallen", and each one is re-derived below
against something measured about this robot or this clip.

## On the numbers below

Following the repository's rule that measurements belong next to the decision --
and its corollary, that a number without provenance is indistinguishable from a
guess -- each weight and threshold says which it is. The clip statistics and the
two torque ratings are measured. **The reward weights are not**: they are starting
points with the reasoning that produced them, and training is what turns them into
measurements.

The other dance tasks (`jumper.dance_brazilian` and its siblings) apply the rules
written here to their own clips, and say so where they do.
