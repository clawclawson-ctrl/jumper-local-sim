        # that walks forward should mirror onto a policy that walks forward, and
        # `mdp/symmetry.py` augments every mini-batch with the mirrored samples.

        # asserts that when the reference raises the left arm, raising the right
        # one is equally correct -- so the augmented half of every mini-batch is
        # labelled with a dance the reference never asks for, and the mirror loss
        # additionally penalises the policy for telling the two apart. The dance is
        # visibly left-right asymmetric (the front arms' yaw ranges are mirror
        # images, but they are traversed at different times), so this is not a
        # borderline case.
