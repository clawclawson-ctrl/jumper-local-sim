"""Environment config for jumper.dance_dream_wings: the dream_wings dance, `media/dream_wings.npz`.

The environment is `tasks/jumper/common/dance/env.py`; this file holds every
number. Where a number follows a rule `jumper.dance` wrote down for its own clip,
the rule is applied to this clip's measurements and the result is quoted -- read
`tasks/jumper/dance/env_cfg.py` for the reasoning behind each rule.

## This clip, measured

At the 50 Hz control rate, after conversion (55.6 s): per-joint position std 0.238
rad at the median and 0.565 at the most active, RMS amplitude 0.285 rad; joint
velocity RMS 2.417 rad/s, per-joint std 2.513 at the median and 4.162 at the most
active, peaking at 15.7 rad/s; the base between 97 and 127 mm; tilt at most 3.5
degrees.

**The reward weights are starting points**, as they are for jumper.dance: no policy
has been trained on this clip in this repository yet.
