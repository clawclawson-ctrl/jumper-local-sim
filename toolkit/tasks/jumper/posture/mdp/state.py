"""What the posture command is measured against: twist, pitch, roll, height.

Four scalars, one function each, and every reward and observation in this task
reads them from here. They are kept apart from the rewards deliberately -- the
same four numbers are scored, logged as metrics by the command term, and handed
to the critic as an observation, and three copies of "how the body's twist is
computed" would be three chances to disagree.

## The frame each one is measured in, which is the whole design

    twist    body yaw **relative to the feet**, by least-squares aligning the
             current footprint onto the HOME footprint
    pitch    body pitch relative to **gravity**
    roll     body roll relative to gravity
    height   base height above the **mean of the feet**

Twist and height are foot-relative because there is nothing else they could mean:
a hexapod standing still can yaw its body over planted feet, and that is the
quantity being commanded, not its heading in the world. `heading` already exists
for the world one and is what `twist`'s `ang_vel_z` integrates to.

Pitch and roll are gravity-relative rather than foot-relative, and that is a
choice with a cost. On the plane these tasks train on the two agree exactly -- the
feet are on z = 0, so the foot plane *is* the horizontal plane. On a slope they
would not, and a foot-plane version is the one that keeps meaning "lean relative
to the ground you are standing on". Gravity is chosen anyway because it is the
one a real robot can measure: an IMU gives pitch and roll directly, and a foot
plane has to be reconstructed from leg kinematics and contact state. When this
task moves onto `--scene rough`, this is the first paragraph to come back to.

## Why the twist needs a reference footprint at all

The feet move. A yaw of the body over a footprint is only defined against some
footprint that counts as untwisted, and the natural one is the stance the robot
holds at HOME -- `constants.NOMINAL_FOOT_XY`, measured off the model and pinned
by `tests/test_posture_stance.py`.

Given that reference, the estimate is a two-dimensional orthogonal Procrustes
problem, which in the plane has a closed form rather than needing an SVD:

    theta = atan2( sum_i (n_i x p_i),  sum_i (n_i . p_i) )

where `p_i` is foot `i` in the body frame with the footprint's centroid removed
and `n_i` is the same for the reference. `theta` is the yaw of the *stance*
relative to the body, so the body's twist relative to the stance is `-theta`.

**Centroid removal is what makes it a rotation estimate rather than a translation
one.** Without it, a robot that has simply shifted its body forward over its feet
-- which is most of what walking is -- reads as a twist, because the whole
footprint is then offset in x and the cross terms do not cancel.

**Swinging legs are included, and that is deliberate.** The obvious refinement is
to weight by contact, so only planted feet vote; it was not done, for two reasons.
A tripod gait has three feet in the air half the time and their positions are a
continuous function of the same joints, so they carry the same yaw information
with a lead rather than a bias -- and a contact-weighted estimate changes its
divisor six times a cycle, which puts a step discontinuity into a reward the
policy is being asked to hold constant. What the airborne feet do add is cycle
ripple, which is real and is the reason `track_twist`'s std is not tight; see the
note there.
