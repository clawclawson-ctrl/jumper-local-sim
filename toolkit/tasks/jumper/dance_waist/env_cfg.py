"""Environment config for jumper.dance_waist: the waist (waist-twist) dance, `media/waist.npz`.

The environment is `tasks/jumper/common/dance/env.py`; this file holds every
number. Where a number follows a rule `jumper.dance` wrote down for its own clip,
the rule is applied to this clip's measurements and the result is quoted -- read
`tasks/jumper/dance/env_cfg.py` for the reasoning behind each rule.

## This clip, measured

At the 50 Hz control rate, after conversion (56.6 s): per-joint position std 0.140
rad at the median and 0.488 at the most active, RMS amplitude 0.219 rad; joint
velocity RMS 1.465 rad/s, per-joint std 0.958 at the median and 2.609 at the most
active, peaking at 8.7 rad/s; the base between 107 and 138 mm; tilt at most 7.6
degrees.

**The reward weights are starting points**, as they are for jumper.dance: no policy
has been trained on this clip in this repository yet.
