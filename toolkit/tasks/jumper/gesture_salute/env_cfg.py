"""Environment config for jumper.gesture_salute: the salute, `media/salute.npz`.

The environment is `tasks/jumper/common/dance/env.py`; this file holds every
number. Where a number follows a rule `jumper.dance` wrote down for its own clip,
the rule is applied to this clip's measurements and the result is quoted -- read
`tasks/jumper/dance/env_cfg.py` for the reasoning behind each rule.

## This clip, measured

At the 50 Hz control rate, after conversion (6.0 s, lead-in and lead-out included):
per-joint position std 0.192 rad at the median and 0.700 at the most active, RMS
amplitude 0.309 rad; joint velocity RMS 0.849 rad/s, per-joint std 0.458 at the
median and 1.383 at the most active, peaking at 7.8 rad/s; the base between 104 and
154 mm; tilt at most 6.7 degrees.

**The reward weights are starting points**, as they are for jumper.dance: no policy
has been trained on this clip in this repository yet.
