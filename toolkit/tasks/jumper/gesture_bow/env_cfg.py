"""Environment config for jumper.gesture_bow: the bow, `media/bow.npz`.

The environment is `tasks/jumper/common/dance/env.py`; this file holds every
number. Where a number follows a rule `jumper.dance` wrote down for its own clip,
the rule is applied to this clip's measurements and the result is quoted -- read
`tasks/jumper/dance/env_cfg.py` for the reasoning behind each rule.

## This clip, measured

At the 50 Hz control rate, after conversion (8.6 s, lead-in and lead-out included):
per-joint position std 0.185 rad at the median and 0.721 at the most active, RMS
amplitude 0.275 rad; joint velocity RMS 0.555 rad/s, per-joint std 0.482 at the
median and 1.072 at the most active, peaking at 4.6 rad/s; the base between 107 and
117 mm; tilt at most 7.9 degrees.

**The reward weights are starting points**, as they are for jumper.dance: no policy
has been trained on this clip in this repository yet.
