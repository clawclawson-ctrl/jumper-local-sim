//! `jumper.five_foot` on the robot: the claw on either side, from one policy,
//! closed by the control on its side and held out on three more.
//!
//! The policy is trained with the **left**-front leg carried as the claw and the
//! other five walking. An operator may want the claw on the right. Nothing about
//! the right is trained -- the robot is not asymmetric enough for that to be
//! worth a second policy -- so the right is the left, mirrored: the controller
//! shows the policy a robot reflected in its own x-z plane, and reflects the
//! answer back. The policy sees the claw on the left, exactly as it was trained,
//! while the robot carries it on the right.
//!
//! This is `rl-wbc-fsm`'s `carry_mirror`, moved out of the controller into this
//! task's own library, and with its per-joint signs taken from the robot's joint
//! axes rather than guessed from the home pose.
//!
//! ## What the mirror does, at each hook point
//!
//! Reflecting in the x-z plane (`y -> -y`):
//!
//! * **joints**: each joint is presented as its left-right twin (`LF_*` as
//!   `RF_*`, `LM_*` as `RM_*`, `LR_*` as `RR_*`), times a sign -- `+1` for the
//!   front arms' shoulder pitch, whose axis is y, and `-1` for every other joint,
//!   whose axis is x or z. Positions, velocities and torques alike; gains move
//!   with their joint and keep their sign.
//! * **IMU**: a polar vector (linear velocity, gravity) flips its y; an axial one
//!   (angular velocity, attitude) flips the components about x and z and keeps
//!   the one about y. So `gyro -> (-x, y, -z)`, `lin_vel -> (x, -y, z)`, and the
//!   orientation `(w, x, y, z) -> (w, -x, y, -z)`, which is gravity's y flipped
//!   once the observation projects it.
//! * **command**: `lin_vel_y`, the yaw rate, the roll and the twist flip; forward
//!   speed, pitch and height do not -- pitch is about y, perpendicular to the
//!   mirror, which is why both jumper pose commands measure it nose-down positive
//!   now and neither needs a special case here.
//!
//! The map is its own inverse, so one function serves both directions:
//! `before_observation` takes the robot into the policy's frame and
//! `after_decode` brings the decoded command back, and `home_pose` sends the
//! policy's home pose -- claw on the left, held stowed -- to the
//! robot as the same pose with the claw on the right, which the controller ramps
//! to before this mode's policy takes over.
//!
//! ## What it needs of the robot
//!
//! That the right half is the mirror image of the left, joint for joint. It is
//! measured to be, for every pair: the axis-derived sign maps each joint's range
//! onto its twin's exactly (`tests/test_five_foot_deploy.py`). The home poses
//! agree to 0.043 rad, the worst being `J3` on the front arms -- the V1.6.1 right
//! half is a rotated copy of the left rather than a mirrored one, open with the
//! mechanical team -- so the mirrored home is that much off the robot's own, well
//! inside the ramp's 0.10 rad tolerance.
//!
//! ## The claw's finger
//!
//! The policy does not drive the claw. Its finger is out of the action, and the
//! decoder holds it at the contract's home pose -- open -- like every joint no
//! policy drives. This library drives it instead, from the task control on the
//! carried claw's side: `claw_left` with the claw on the left, `claw_right` on
//! the right -- `LT` and `RT` on the pad, which is how `control-agent` has
//! always handed a gripper to the arm it is on, and Space on the keyboard for
//! either, as Control-agent 3.1 has it. The control's travel is the claw's: let
//! go is 60 degrees open, all the way is `GRIPPER_CLOSED`, and halfway is
//! halfway; let go while the arm is held out at a preset is 90 degrees open --
//! rl-wbc-fsm V3.1's two numbers, both from the shut end. The target never leads
//! the finger's measured angle by more than `SQUEEZE_LEAD` towards shut, so a
//! finger stopped by an object squeezes with the servo's `kp * lead` however
//! hard the control is held -- `claw.py` has what that is worth to the gait,
//! measured.
//!
//! **The policy trained on less of that travel**: `GRIPPER_OPEN` to shut, 37
//! degrees of it, and the finger is one of the joints it observes. Wider than
//! `GRIPPER_OPEN` it is shown the finger at `GRIPPER_OPEN`, still; inside that,
//! as it is -- the angle an object stops the finger at is the object's, and the
//! policy trained on exactly that.
//!
//! It is set in the policy's frame, on the carried claw's own joint
//! (`LF_J4_joint`), just before the mirror: on the right, the mirror carries it
//! to `RF_J4_joint` with the sign every finger takes. Only while the policy
//! runs -- the ramp and the hold keep the finger at the mode's home pose, open.
//! The controls are the task's by its `controls.yaml` (`task:`), by name, and
//! each device puts them where it likes; what the controller holds
//! [`ModeHook::reads`] to is the names.
//!
//! ## The arm, held out while its control is
//!
//! The arm stows -- the contract's home pose, `claw.py::LF_GRASP` -- and three
//! controls hold it out straight, one way each, for as long as they are held:
//! `arm_thumb_up`, `arm_thumb_down` and `arm_web_up`, the d-pad's up, down and
//! left on the pad and Shift, Alt and Ctrl on the keyboard. Let go, it goes back
//! to the stow. That is Control-agent 3.1's layout, asked for on 2026-09-29
//! ("开关量 ... 松开后回位"); until then a direction was a press, read when it
//! was let go, pressed again to stow -- all a key through MuJoCo's viewer could
//! deliver when it was written. The presets, the gains, the interpolation and
//! the stow's pitch follow are rl-wbc-fsm's `config/hexa/rl-wbc-fsm.toml`
//! `[arm]` as of V3.1 (`fix/control_agent_v3.1`, 15e8d7d), verbatim, which is
//! what the robot runs them with: angles in degrees for shoulder yaw, pitch,
//! elbow and wrist, `kp` 3.0 and `kd` 0.3, and the setpoint moved `ARM_INTERP`
//! of the way to its target on every decode (50 Hz, where rl-wbc-fsm ran it on
//! every inference too).
//!
//! ```text
//!     arm_thumb_up     straight out, the thumb up       [-90, -180,   0,  -1]
//!     arm_thumb_down   straight out, the thumb down     [-90,  -30,  30,  -1]
//!     arm_web_up       straight out, the thumb-web up   [-90,  -90,   0,  -1]
//! ```
//!
//! Thumb up and down are 3.0's right and left moved, and the web is 3.0's up
//! recalibrated on the robot. **Two held at once is the pose between them**, the
//! mean of the two: the thumb at 45 degrees between up and the web, or between
//! the web and down -- 3.1's "混合时，角度为45度". Thumb up and thumb down
//! together are neither, as the d-pad's two ends cannot both be down: a keyboard
//! can hold Shift and Alt at once. V3.1's diagonals -- up and a side, the arm
//! swung 45 degrees out towards it -- are gone with the press they were chosen on.
//!
//! The dances are the pad's `menu` and a direction. That chord enters the dance
//! on the press, the claw mode stops ticking, and the direction never reaches
//! the arm (`deploy/fsm/src/config.rs::FsmConfig::chord_leaves_first` holds the
//! bundle to that). The keyboard's Ctrl, the web preset here, is not a dance's
//! modifier in the claw modes at all: the manifest keeps those switches out of
//! them with `from`.
//!
//! **The operator's pitch moves the arm at the stow**, as in V3.1: the shoulder
//! pitch follows it -- `SHOULDER_FOLLOW_NOSE_DOWN` rad at a full stick nose
//! down, `SHOULDER_FOLLOW_NOSE_UP` nose up, which is 57 degrees of shoulder. The
//! stick is the command this library is handed divided by its full standing
//! deflection, which is the stick exactly while standing; walking, the command
//! is held to 15 degrees and the follow to three quarters, where rl-wbc-fsm
//! reads the stick itself. **A held preset does not follow**: 3.1 gives the
//! preset priority over the stick ("优先级高于Ry对手臂的控制"). Until
//! 2026-09-29 the elbow followed at up and down, V3.1's `elbow_pitch_follow`.
//!
//! So, as there, **this library holds the arm for as long as the mode runs**,
//! at the stow as well: at `ARM_KP` / `ARM_KD`, not the 10 the policy trained
//! its hold at. Were both shoulder gains zero, it would hand the arm back to the
//! decoder once its setpoint was home within `RETURN_TOL`, as rl-wbc-fsm does.
//!
//! **The policy is shown the arm at home** while this library holds it: the
//! four joints' angle and torque in the observation are the ones measured on
//! the last tick before it took the arm, and the velocity zero, until the arm
//! is handed back **and measured** inside `GRASP_BOX` of the stow -- the setpoint
//! gets there well before the arm, at these gains. The policy was trained with
//! the arm inside that box; the presets are about a radian away, which in an
//! input that has never varied by more is not a measurement but noise of
//! unknown effect on every leg. Hidden, the observation stays in distribution
//! and what the policy meets is the mass moving -- the kind of disturbance the
//! payload curriculum trains against.
//!
//! **On the right** the table is the left's, mirrored with everything else. The
//! thumb's direction is the hand's own, and so is a blend of two, so nothing
//! swaps: the right arm's thumb-up is its own thumb up. The stow's follow is
//! mirrored too, as the shoulder pitch keeps its sign under the mirror.
//!
//! Measured on V1.6.1 (`grasp_pose.py`'s `Claw`, on the visual meshes, the
//! trunk level unless said), 2026-09-28. At a level stick every preset is
//! inside the soft limits, the forearm 13.7 mm or more from the trunk and its
//! neighbouring legs and 61.6 mm or more above the floor; the finger at 90
//! degrees brings `down` to 34.5 mm. The straight joint-space path from the
//! stow to `down` dips to 7.7 mm above the floor on the way. The follow is
//! where it is tight:
//!
//! * nose up, a full stick: the stow's shoulder brings the finger, at 60
//!   degrees, to 1.0 mm of the trunk or a neighbouring leg (15.8 mm at 37). With
//!   V3.1's elbow follow, which a held preset no longer has, `down`'s elbow
//!   reached 1.52 rad, past the 1.46 soft limit, 9.3 mm from them;
//! * nose down, it takes the claw towards the floor. With the trunk turned 20
//!   degrees about its origin at the standing height -- a crude stand-in for how
//!   the robot leans -- the arm's lowest point is under the floor by 2 mm at the
//!   stow without the follow and 28 mm with it, 19 and 137 mm at `up`, 25 and
//!   105 mm at `down`. The elbow's sign turned round would leave `up` 36 mm
//!   above it. Whether reaching down as the nose goes down is what the robot's
//!   operators want is theirs to say; this is what they tuned.
//!
//! ## Configuring it
//!
//! A mode in `deploy/manifests.json` names this task and carries
//! `"hook": {"side": "right"}` or `{"side": "left"}` -- the second is the trained
//! side and mirrors nothing, and saying so is what makes the pair of modes read
//! as a choice. `side` is required; any other key is refused.
