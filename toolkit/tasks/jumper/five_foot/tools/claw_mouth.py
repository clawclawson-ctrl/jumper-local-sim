"""Does the claw's **collision** have a mouth, or only its picture?

    python tasks/jumper/five_foot/tools/claw_mouth.py
    python tasks/jumper/five_foot/tools/claw_mouth.py --finger -0.50 --model assets/jumper/jumper.xml
    python tasks/jumper/five_foot/tools/claw_mouth.py --pieces <dir of LF_palm_link_col*.STL / LF_finger_link_col*.STL>

MuJoCo collides a mesh by its convex hull, and the hull of a hooked jaw is filled
in across the mouth. In `jumper.five_foot` both of this claw's jaws are therefore
convex-*decomposed* (`tasks/jumper/five_foot/tools/jaw_decompose.py`, put on that task's robot by
`tasks/jumper/five_foot/jaws.py`; the shared asset keeps one hull each) -- and the
failure when one of them is not is completely silent. Nothing errors, nothing
looks wrong on screen, and the claw simply meets every object a couple of
centimetres before the part touches it: the fixed jaw shoves things it is not
touching, and the moving jaw can never push anything into a mouth that is solid.

## What it measures

The mouth is a wedge, so one number for it would be a choice of where to look.
This walks **along** it instead, in bands of distance from the finger's hinge,
and at each band takes the narrowest place across the mouth and asks how much
room a point in the middle of it has:

  * **drawn** -- to the nearest vertex of either jaw's *visual* mesh, which is
    the claw in the picture;
  * **collided** -- to the nearest collision shape, from MuJoCo itself
    (`mj_geomDistance` against a point-sized probe geom, so it is the hull the
    solver uses and not a copy of it).

A convex piece is never thinner than the band it covers, so `collided` can only
be the smaller of the two. How much smaller is the whole question.

Measured on the V1.6 asset at finger -0.90, with each jaw as one hull and as it
is cut (`LF_palm_link` in six pieces, `LF_finger_link` in three):

    from the hinge     drawn    one hull     cut
        40 mm         12.1 mm     0.0 mm     10.5 mm
        55 mm         19.7 mm     3.4 mm     18.6 mm
        70 mm         34.7 mm    23.1 mm     33.9 mm
        85 mm         33.6 mm    25.5 mm     33.3 mm
       100 mm         31.2 mm    27.3 mm     31.1 mm

With one hull the middle of the mouth is *inside* the fixed jaw at the knuckle
end and 8 to 16 mm short of the part over the grip face -- which is the bug this
check exists for, and the reason an object could be shoved by a jaw with daylight
between them. Even at the tip the hull still takes 4 mm.

The first band is the knuckle end, where the two jaws are two halves of one hinge
and a hull's own thickness has nowhere to go; `claw.py::KNUCKLE_CLEAR` is where
the mouth is taken to start, the same number `grasp_pose.py` and `mdp/grasp.py`
measure from.

    """The robot with the task's collision scheme applied, plus a probe.

    `jumper.xml` is the URDF export; the contact structure is the task's and mjlab
    writes it in when it builds the entity, so a bare compile would measure a
    different robot from the one that runs.

    The probe is a point-sized sphere, `contype=0` and `conaffinity=0` so it
    takes no part in anything -- `mj_geomDistance` is a geometry query and does
    not consult either. Moving it is how a *point* gets measured against the
    solver's collision shapes, which MuJoCo has no other API for. It hangs off
    the worldbody with no joint and `room` writes its `geom_xpos` straight into
    `MjData`: a free body would need a mass and an inertia the compiler accepts,
    and there is nothing to simulate here.

    `pieces` re-points each decomposed jaw's collision geoms at whatever
    `<link>_col*.STL` a directory holds, which is how a cut is compared against
    one hull, or against another cut, with this very code. A cut with more pieces
    than the model has geoms gets the extra geoms added, copied from the first; a
    cut with fewer leaves the spare geoms on its last piece, so a coarser cut is
    measured as a coarser cut rather than as a model that fails to compile.
    `--pieces assets/jumper/meshes` is the shared asset's one hull each: its
    `<link>_col.STL` is the only file there that matches.
