"""The claw and the objects, in **plain MuJoCo**: no mjlab, no managers, no scene.

    python tasks/jumper/five_foot/tools/pick_place.py --bundle tasks/jumper/five_foot/out/model_6999

kk-rl-lab's `deploy/hexa_5d/backends/mujoco/` in one file: build the model, load
an exported policy, step MuJoCo, drive it from the keyboard. It exists because
that is the arrangement this robot is actually deployed under -- a plain MuJoCo
model, a policy that reads a flat observation vector and a controller that writes
torques -- and a second implementation of it here is the only thing that can
disagree with `scripts/play.py`. Where they disagree, one of them is wrong, and
finding that out in simulation is cheap.

**Nothing here goes through `scenes/`.** The objects are attached to the robot's
spec directly, which is the shape `pick_place.py` has there.

What it does **not** share with `scripts/play.py` is everything that matters:

    play.py                         this
    mjlab env + managers            MuJoCo model and data
    warp or the native backend      mujoco.mj_step
    observations from the manager   assembled here, from layout.json
    actions through an action term  torque written to qfrc_applied
    the servo actuator class        the same curve, reimplemented in numpy

So the two agree only if the contract is right, which is the point.
`tasks/jumper/five_foot/tools/mujoco_parity.py` is the check that says whether they do.

## Standing is right; walking is not, yet

Commanded nothing, this is the same robot: it settles at 106 mm against a 105 mm
nominal, |action| 0.33, 0.7 N*m of torque, joint velocities at 0.00 rad/s, and it
stays there. Commanded 0.3 m/s forward it travels 0.107 m in 10 s where the
manager-driven environment travels 2.87, thrashing in place with actions of the
same size.

Each half of the loop has been verified against that environment and each half
works:

  - the compiled models are identical field by field -- joint ranges, armature,
    damping, friction, solref, solimp, condim, priority, contype, masses,
    inertias and every solver option;
  - the observation is identical for the same state, term by term, to 1.2e-07;
  - the torque curve is identical to 2.2e-16 and the PD is the same law;
  - the ONNX and the training policy agree to 1.7e-06 on live observations;
  - **this simulation walks 2.52 m in 10 s when replayed with the environment's
    actions**, tracking its trajectory to 6 mm over the first 250 steps;
  - **the environment walks 1.87 m when driven by this file's observations.**

So both halves work when crossed and the loop does not when closed, which is the
signature of a feedback phase rather than a wrong quantity. That is what is being
looked for; until it is found, drive this to look at the scene and the claw, and
use `scripts/play.py` to judge a gait.

## The geometry is the repository's, the plumbing is not

The prop shapes come from `objects.py` -- a bar of soap, a notebook, a can and a
bin, each a primitive of one material. Copying them into this file would make two
rows that drift apart; reading them here is not the same thing as running the
task's `--objects` setup through mjlab, which is what this avoids.

## Keys

    arrows            forward / back / strafe
    A / D             turn            R  stop
    KP 8 / 2          nose down / up  KP 4 / 6  roll   KP 7 / 9  twist  KP 5  level
    [ / ]             open / close the claw
    X                 reset
    space             pause

Nothing is welded. The claw holds what it squeezes the way a real one does, by
friction: `]` until the jaws stop on an object and it comes up with the claw, `[`
and it drops. Before that the props are moved by contact and nothing else, so the
claw can be walked into one and push it. The friction that holds is the objects
scene's own solver settings (`tasks/jumper/five_foot/objects.py::PROP_CONE`), set here on the
model that carries the objects and on no other.
