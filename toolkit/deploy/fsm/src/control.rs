//! One tick, in two phases, for whichever mode the FSM has chosen.
//!
//! `fsm.rs` decides *which* mode. This decides what a tick does inside one, and
//! it is where the three regimes live:
//!
//! | regime | when | what it commands |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | warm start | the state sets `warm_start` | a slide to the hand-off pose, at the state's own soft gains |
//! | ramp | a model state was just entered, and the robot is not at its default pose | a slide to **that model's** default pose, at the ramp gains |
//! | policy | a model state, at its default pose | observation -> inference -> joint targets |
//! | hold | anything else, including a model that cannot run | damping around the measured pose |
//!
//! ## Why the tick is split
//!
//! In a browser the model runs in onnxruntime-web, which is JavaScript: a wasm
//! module cannot call it and return inside one synchronous call. So `tick`
//! returns either finished targets or a request, and the host answers the
//! request with `resume`.
//!
//! That is not a concession. The loop was already going to be split, because it
//! publishes faster than it infers -- `rl-wbc-fsm` runs the output at 1 kHz and
//! the policy at the contract's `control_hz` (50 for locomotion, 200 for a jump),
//! holding the last decoded target in between. Making the split a return type
//! rather than a timer comparison buys the property this whole design is for:
//! `tick` is a pure function of `(state, inputs, now)`, so one recorded episode
//! replays identically in a test, in a browser and on a bench.
//!
//! ## Two things that look like details and are not
//!
//! **The hand-off waits on the measured pose, not on the clock.**
//! `mode_switch_ramp_s` is how fast the setpoint slides; the policy starts only
//! once every joint is within `pose_reach_tol` of the model's default pose. Gains
//! too soft to converge mean the hand-off waits indefinitely and the robot
//! soft-holds. That is deliberate -- the alternative is starting a policy from a
//! pose it was never trained around -- and the fix is firmer gains, not a timer.
//!
//! **A model that momentarily cannot run must not re-ramp.** Holding is right;
//! clearing the active mode as well would re-enter the ramp on the next tick and
//! do it again, giving a robot that twitches once per failed inference instead of
//! standing still. Only a real hold state clears it.
