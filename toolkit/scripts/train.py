"""Unified train entry point.

This script **imports no task's config classes**. It knows only the registry at
the top of tasks/, and configs are loaded by `tasks.load_env_cfg` /
`load_agent_cfg` following the conventions of a task directory. Adding a robot or
a task requires no change under scripts/.

Pick the task with `--task` and the model asset with `--model`; `--list` shows the
choices for both. The backend comes from `--backend` / `--device`, or is
auto-detected (see mjrl.backend.resolve).

The live viewer is **on by default**, works on both backends, and draws **at most
128 environments** (all of them below 128; `--viewer-env-num` changes it). The two
reasons for the cap are in `_resolve_draw_limit` in mjrl/viewer/live.py. Turn it
off with `--headless`; with no usable display it goes headless automatically.

**TensorBoard is started automatically** on this run's log directory (the whole
task by default, so the previous run is there to compare against) and the URL is
printed. Turn it off with `--no-tensorboard`.

**Training resumes with `--resume`**, from the newest checkpoint under
`logs/<model>/<task>/`, or from the one `--checkpoint` names. What is restored is
the whole training state -- policy, value function, optimiser (so the adaptive
learning-rate schedule keeps its place), the iteration counter and the
environment's step counter, which is what curricula count in -- rather than the
weights alone, so a resumed run continues rather than restarts from a warm
policy.
