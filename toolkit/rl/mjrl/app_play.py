"""Play an app in mjlab: every mode of it, through the deployment controller.

    python scripts/play.py --app out/bundle_<timestamp>/<name>.app

An `.app` is what `scripts/deploy.py` writes: one bundle every host
loads -- the robot, a browser, and this. `--app` opens it as the third of those
and runs all of it:

* **every mode**, entered the way the robot enters them: the bundle's own
  `controller.toml` cascade, on its own buttons and keys;
* **the person**, read through each mode's own controls: the viewer's keys and,
  when one is plugged in, a gamepad -- sticks, triggers, buttons and the d-pad;
* **the controller's own output**. The joint targets and gains it publishes are
  what the simulated servos track, so its ramps, its output filter, its joint
  stops and a task's deploy hook -- `jumper.five_foot`'s mirror, its claw on the
  trigger, its arm on the d-pad -- all reach the joints, and how wide a mode's
  action is stays the controller's business rather than the environment's.

The environment is the world and nothing more: the physics, the robot model and
its servo curve, the terrain, and a reset when the robot falls. Its own
observation, commands and rewards are not read, and it is built from the task
of the app's default mode unless `--task` names another.

This replaced `play --fsm`, which ran the controller's observation and cascade
but handed the policy's raw action back to mjlab to decode: no hook reached the
simulator, no key reached the controller, and a bundle with a recorded motion
in it did not load at all.

## Keys through MuJoCo's viewer

`mjrl.viewer.keys` hands over each key going down and coming up -- MuJoCo's
viewer itself reports the press alone, and that module says how the release is
had. They are queued on the viewer's thread and handed to the controller once a
step, on the simulation's, in the order they came: a key is held for as long as
it is held, and a chord is Ctrl held, then right. A tap shorter than a step is
down for one step and up at the next, so a `toggle` or a `rise` still sees it.
Until 2026-09-29 the release was inferred from auto-repeats the viewer never
reports, and every key came up 0.75 s after its press.

The viewer's own shortcuts fire beside these (`controller/vocabulary.json`,
`_keys_note`): Space also pauses the picture, and the arrows step a paused one.
