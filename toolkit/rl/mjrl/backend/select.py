"""Choose which `Simulation` implementation the environment is built with.

This is the **using side** of the seam. The seam itself is in the vendored
`rl/mjlab/sim/__init__.py` (`set_simulation_cls` / `get_simulation_cls`) and in
the one construction in `rl/mjlab/envs/manager_based_rl_env.py`; both carry
`[mjrl]` markers.

Timing matters: **this must run before the env is built.** The construction in
`ManagerBasedRlEnv.__init__` consults the registry once, and changing it after
the env exists has no effect at all.
